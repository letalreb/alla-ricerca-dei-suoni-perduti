    description: `A significant part of the musical instrument collection is housed in Milan, at Casa Giulini, where guests can admire painted harpsichords, harps from the time of Marie Antoinette and the Empire period, richly decorated psalteries, and mandolins. All the instruments are in perfect playing condition and preserve the charm of the "lost sound." In the quiet of a discreet garden in the heart of Milan, the Green Room features a collection of antique wooden stamps used to print fabrics, and the Blue Room is decorated with theatrical backdrops.`,
